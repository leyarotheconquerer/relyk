The more you have the worse it is

Collecting something to play game
But the more you have the more things go wrong


I.e. The more bullet packs you pick up, the more enemies you have
The more money you get, the more monsters attack
The more points you have the more difficult the game gets

Sickness
Galaga
Building things (tower defense)

The towers themselves spawn the monsters?

The more power you have the more likely things are to overload
but you need power to keep going? (but then you always maintain a minimum)
could be good
That would be some sort of vehicle (space or rover?)
Or train
Or dirigible
Or B.O.A.T.
